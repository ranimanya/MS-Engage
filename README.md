# MyVision-MS-Engage-Project 
* **Problem**: Develop a browser-based application or a native mobile application to demonstrate application of Face Recognition technology.
* **My idea**: In face-to-face social interactions, *blind and visually impaired persons* lack access to nonverbal cues like *facial expressions*, gestures and other general details such as *age*, *gender* and *race* which may lead to impaired interpersonal communication. 
* **Solution**: Here is the design and implementation of a face detection and recognition system for the visually impaired through the use of mobile computing. 
Here, I attempted to build a mobile application which gives *voice output to the user to facilittate interaction*
* **Technology used**: Python, Opencv, Deepface, gTTs(Google-Text-To-Speech), Kivy-Python
